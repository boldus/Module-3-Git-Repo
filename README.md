Module 3 Challange: Password Generator
User Story:
For this module we were given the task of creating a random Password Generator that could provide more 
secure passwords for a ficticious company.

The password generator should provide multiple prompts when beggining the generation process
The first being the length of the password itself, which could range from 8-128 characters
It would then ask for the specific characters that the password would be comprised of
Including: Upper and lower case letters, special characters, and numbers
So we first needed to make arrays for those character types
Then we needed to establish our first prompt, which was character length
We also needed a prompt to let people know our acceptable character range in case they are outside of it
While the user doesn't need to use all of the character types they do need at least one to make it
So I established a prompt that would make them restart if they did not select one.
